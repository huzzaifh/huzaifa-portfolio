            <p> JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
                
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
                
                Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
                Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</p></div>

            <p> Code efficiency is a broad term used to depict the reliability, speed and programming methodology used in developing codes for an application. Code efficiency is directly linked with algorithmic efficiency and the speed of runtime execution for software. It is the key element in ensuring high performance. The goal of code efficiency is to reduce resource consumption and completion time as much as possible with minimum risk to the business or operating environment. The software product quality can be accessed and evaluated with the help of the efficiency of the code used.</p></div>
